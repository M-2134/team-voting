# Retrospective – Saad Ali (Group 07)

## What went well?
I worked on the computer vision side of our project, specifically using OpenCV and TensorFlow to build a shape and color tracker. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I’m glad I got to apply my interest in AI and engineering in a real-world scenario. The core functionality worked well and was able to integrate with the app eventually. Vac week was a cool opportunity to explore things we wouldn’t normally cover in class.

## What didn’t go well?
The hardest part was figuring out how to properly integrate my work with the rest of the team’s code, especially since we were working in Next.js and others were handling frontend/backend logic. There were moments where it felt like things were disjointed, and that made collaboration harder than it needed to be. I also think some team members didn’t contribute equally, which added to the stress.

## What can we improve?
Vac week could be improved by making sure every team member is responsible for a specific section of the program — something that’s trackable. For example, having structured GitHub repos created for us from the start, where everyone must push code, would make it easier to see who actually did what. That way, we’re not left anxious during presentations when asked about features we didn’t touch.

## Final thoughts
Overall, I’m glad I got to work on something aligned with what I enjoy — computer vision and machine learning. Even though there were challenges, I learned how to troubleshoot integration issues and collaborate under pressure. If we had a bit more structure around version control and task division, the experience would have been even better.
